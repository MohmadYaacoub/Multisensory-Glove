# Multimodal sensorized glove
This work proposes a low-cost multisensory glove
(â‰ˆ 140 USD) equipped with commercial piezoresistive force
sensors (FSRs) and inertial measurement units (IMUs) for object
recognition. A set of 28 daily life objects is used to evaluate the
glove by applying grasping actions. The raw signals acquired
through these actions are employed directly to train a shallow
one-dimensional convolutional neural network. The network is
deployed on a low-cost edge system to perform online object
recognition, thereby presenting an end-to-end system. The pro-
posed system achieves a classification accuracy of 99.29% while
consuming only 59.85 mW and 0.4875 mJ of power and energy
per inference respectively. Overall, the proposed system seems
a suitable candidate for various biomedical applications such as
post-stroke rehabilitation.
